## 🏁 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd FlipPiece-Backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create `.env.development.local` with:
     ```
     PORT=5500
     URL=http://localhost
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_PORT=5432
     DB_USERNAME=your_db_user
     DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
     DB_NAME=flippiece_db
     DB_DIALECT=postgres
     DHL_API_KEY=your_dhl_api_key
     DHL_API_SECRET=your_dhl_api_secret
     DHL_API_BASE_URL=https://api-sandbox.dhl.com/parcel/de
     FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
     ```

3. **Set up Firebase:**
   - Add your Firebase service account key to `config/firebaseServiceAccount.json`
   - Ensure Firebase Admin is properly configured

4. **Run migrations and seeders:**
   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   
   ```

5. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The API will be available at `http://localhost:5500/`.

## 🔐 Authentication Flow
1. Frontend authenticates users via Firebase Auth
2. Frontend sends Firebase ID token in Authorization header
3. Backend middleware verifies the token using Firebase Admin
4. User data is attached to `req.user` for use in controllers

---

## 🧪 Testing
- Run tests with:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- Tests available for: users, products, orders

---

## 🔧 Development Scripts
- `npm start` — Start production server
- `npm run dev` — Start development server with nodemon
- `npm test` — Run Jest tests
